### About

This cyberdeck is made around existing components that I already had namely:

- BOYI 65% keyboard
- Lepow 15.6" 1080P portable monitor
- Raspberry Pi 4 with 8GB RAM

The only cool thing about this cyberdeck is the trackpad which is made up of 4 ToF ranging sensors arranged above the keyboard.

Then two tactile buttons for left/right click. These together are used to emulate an HID mouse.
